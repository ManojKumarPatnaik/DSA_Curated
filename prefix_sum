1) To calculate sum in array from range a to b we need to iterate over the array, so if there m queries we need to iterate array m times hence TC=m*need
2) To Solve this issue we use prefix sum array in prefix sum array we store the sum till that index 
for ex : a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
         prefix_sum = [1,3,6,10,15,21]

         Here the sum till index at 1 is 3 viz sum(prefix_sum in range [0,1])

         in general sum = prefix_sum(a[i,j] = a[j]-a[i-1])
3)It takes O(n) time to calculate prefix sum array of n size.
4) It takes O(1) time to calculate sum in a particular range.
