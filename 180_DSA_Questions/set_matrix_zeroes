Brute force Approach:

Points to ask in interviews: 1) what will be the range of values since we will be changing 
the values we need to make sure we do it with out of range values.
1)First traverse the matrix and if matrix[i][j] == 0 change all the non zero values to an put of range value ex:-1
2)Then traverse the matrix again and change all the -1s to 0s.
3)We don't change 0 values as it might affect other rows and cols.

T.C: O(NxM) x O(N+M)
S.C: O(1)

Better Approach:

1) We create two arrays row and col.
2) We traverse the matrix and every time we encounter a 0 for that position we update the row and col values i.e if mat[i][j]==0 then row[i]=0 and col[j]=0
3) We traverse the matrix again and check if row[i] or col[j] == 0 then we set mat[i][j]=0

T.C: O(NxM + NxM) -> Since we are traversing the matrix twice
S.C: O(N) + O(M) -> Since we are creating two extra arrays

Optimal Approach:

1) We will take first row as col array and first col as row array.
2) We will take a variable col0 and mark it as true.
We take this variable so that incase there is a 0 in the first col then it will change the entire col as 0 and the mat[0][0] will also become 0 which will change our col array.
3) If mat[i][j] == 0, then mat[i][0] = 0 and mat[0][j] = 0
4) If mat[i][0]==0 then we set col0 = false i.e if we encounter a 0 in first col we only set col0 as false and don't change the values.
5) We then traverse from the back and check: 
if mat[i][0] == 0 or mat[0][j] == 0 then mat[i][j] = 0
6) We traverse from the back so that we don't change our row and col arrays
7) Once we are done with everything we can update the mat[i][0] based on col0 value

T.C: 2(O(NxM)) -> Since we are traversing the matrix twice
S.C: O(N) + O(M) -> Since we are creating two extra arrays

            for(int j=1; j<cols; j++){
                if(mat[i][j] == 0){
                    mat[i][0] = 0 //if a 0 is encountered we update our dummy arrays
                    mat[0][j] = 0 
                }
            }

        for(int i=rows-1; i>0; i--){
            for(int j=cols-1; j>1; j--){
                if(mat[0][j] || mat[i][0] == 0){
